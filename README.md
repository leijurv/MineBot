# MineBot
How to run:

    ./r

You need to have ant (`brew install ant`) and Java 8 (OpenJDK preferred) 



It helps if you run Minecraft itself first, because it'll read your username and access token from `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/logs/latest.log`


# Zero support for anything but Mac OSX
